## 🚀 About Me
I’m transitioning from IT support into network engineering, building hands-on projects that show my skills in:
- **Routing & Switching** (Cisco IOS, OSPF, BGP, VLANs)
- **Network Automation** (Python, Netmiko, Ansible)
- **Network Design** (IPv4/IPv6 addressing, subnetting, topology planning)
- **Troubleshooting & Analysis** (Wireshark, packet analysis, ACLs)

I use **Packet Tracer, GNS3, and Wireshark** to simulate and document real-world networking scenarios.
