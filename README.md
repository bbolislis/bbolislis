## 🚀 About Me
I’m transitioning from IT support into network engineering, building hands-on projects that show my skills in:
- **Routing & Switching** (Multi NOS, OSPF, BGP, VLANs)
- **Network Automation** (Python, Netmiko, Ansible)
- **Network Security** (IDS/IPS, PFSense/OPNSense, firewalls)
- **Troubleshooting & Analysis** (Wireshark, packet analysis, ACLs, Threat hunting)

I use **Packet Tracer, GNS3, Containerlabs, Wireshark** and other various tools to simulate and document real-world networking scenarios.
